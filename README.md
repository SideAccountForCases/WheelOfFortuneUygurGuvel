Hi there,

First of all, I apologize for the delay. I have been working over 50 hours a week, and on top of that, I experienced an internet outage for almost 4 days (which is still ongoing). I've managed to finish the project, although I'm aware that there are some areas where I could have done better, it should be sufficient for you to get an idea of my overall level.
I set up the project architecture in the way i am familiar with, but I could have also set it up in the way that you requested if we were working together. I have no problem adapting and I'm used to working in a team.

As for the technical aspect:

There is a button code that automatically places the slots. This code also keeps track of the number of slots in a static Func, so other objects can adapt to changes in the number of slots in the future.

There is also a code that automatically creates zones and remaps the slot values based on the minimum and maximum values. We can even use an animation curve to visually adjust these values.

The effect sprites used in the reward section could have been pooled, but I skipped this part to deliver the project without further delay.

The wheel indicator can make a slight tremble after the last slot, which can be polished to make it smoother, but it's working well enough for now.

In any case, I had fun doing it and thank you for taking the time to review my project. Wishing you all the best.

Uygur GÃ¼vel.
